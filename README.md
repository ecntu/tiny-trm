(work in progress)

A simple reproduction of the [Tiny Recursion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871) (TRM) trained on the sudoku-extreme task.

Mainly meant for (my) educational purposes. Tries to follow the notation and pseudocode from the paper, but greatly simplifies the model arch and training.

Also see the [official](https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/TinyRecursiveModels) and [@lucidrains'](https://github.com/lucidrains/tiny-recursive-model) implementations.
